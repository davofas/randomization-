One case is known to be filled with one ounce less than all the other bottles.  A former student proposed a random selection method for finding the case with the bottles that have less water.  Essentially you'll pull one bottle and test it.  If it is 9 ounces, you have found the case that is short.  Let's explore this random test.\n",
